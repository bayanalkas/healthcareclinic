# healthcareclinic

## Project Overview

This repository contains the SQL schema and data insertion files for the Online health care clinic database. The database is designed to store information about books, customers, orders, and stock levels, enabling the functioning of an e-commerce bookstore.

## Files

- `cis421_schema.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements to create the database schema, including tables, views, and other database objects.
- `cis421_data.sql`: This file includes the SQL statements to insert data into the tables, providing a starting dataset for the healthclinic.

## Database Setup

To set up the database, you will need to execute the schema file first to create the structure, followed by the data file to populate the database.

### Prerequisites

- MySQL Server (or another SQL database management system)
- SQL client tool (such as MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or command-line client)

### Initializing the Database

1. Start your SQL server if it's not already running.

2. Open your SQL client tool and connect to the server.

3. Create a new database (optional):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE healthcareclinic;
USE healthcareclinic;

```
